This is a tutorial created by the officer committee of PFW ACM designed to provide an introduction to key parts of developing engaging games in Unity, a popular game development software. 
As Unity is extremely powerful, we have selected only a selection of features that we feel a development team would need to know to be successful in a game jam - a 48 hour event in which one must make a game from scratch.

These features are:
* Movement
* Collision
* Game Over/Win
* Scene Transitions
